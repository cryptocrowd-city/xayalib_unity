If you make any changes to the "BitcoinLib" and "XAYAWrapper" projects, you must recompile them and copy the new DLLs (and PDBs) into the proper folders under the XAYAUnity folder. i.e.:

\XAYAUnity\Assets\Plugins\BitcoinLib.dll
\XAYAUnity\Assets\JsonDotNet\Assemblies\Windows\XAYAWrapper.dll

Open the XAYAUnity folder in Unity Editor. You're good to go.

NOTE: You should have the XAYA Electron wallet running.
